# Chapter 1: Character Creation Hell

My head felt like someone had used it for batting practice. Again. 

"God, I really need to stop drinking on weeknights." I groaned and tried to roll over, but something wasn't right. The ground under me was way too hard, and it smelled like... garbage? "Wait, this isn't my apartment."

I cracked open one eye and immediately regretted it. A bright blue interface box hovered right in front of my face, completely blocking my view. What the hell?

**[WELCOME TO ETERNAL REALMS ONLINE]**
**[PLEASE SELECT YOUR CHARACTER]**

"Are you kidding me right now?" I sat up way too fast and immediately paid for it with a wave of nausea. "Did I black out and buy some new VR headset? I don't even remember—"

The character selection screen showed sixteen different avatars. Eight guys, eight girls. But all the female options were grayed out, completely inaccessible. Classic.

"Of course I can't play as a cute girl. There goes my plan to beg for starting gold." I rubbed my temples, trying to think through the hangover fog. "Whatever, let's just get this over with."

I scrolled through the male options—your typical fantasy lineup. Warrior, Mage, Rogue, the usual suspects. Then I spotted something at the bottom of the list.

**[RANDOM CHARACTER GENERATOR]**
**[Spin for a chance to unlock advanced classes normally restricted until level 100!]**

"Oh, come on. Who falls for gacha mechanics in character creation?" But even as I said it, my finger was already hovering over the button. "It's probably rigged anyway."

I tapped it before I could think better of it.

**[RANDOM CHARACTER CREATION SELECTED]**
**[WARNING: CHOICE IS IRREVERSIBLE]**

"Wait, what? Back, back!" I frantically tried to swipe away from the screen, but nothing happened. "Cancel! Undo! Come on, there's got to be a—"

The interface flickered, and a spinning wheel appeared. It cycled through dozens of class names before finally stopping.

**[CLASS SELECTION COMPLETE]**
**[WELCOME, COMMANDER OF PUPPETS]**

"Commander of Puppets?" I blinked at the screen, then shrugged. "Well, could be worse. Looks like some kind of summoner build. Let's see what I'm working with."

A new window popped up showing my skill tree. One lonely skill sat at the top.

**[SUMMON LESSER GOLEM - LV 1]**

"That's it? One skill?" I stared at the pathetic excuse for a starting loadout. "What kind of game gives you one ability to start with? This better not be one of those pay-to-win pieces of—"

**[PLEASE ENTER CHARACTER NAME]**

Right, names. I was terrible at names, but after that random class roll, maybe I should go with something epic.

I typed: xXPussySlayer69Xx

**[NAME UNAVAILABLE]**

"Seriously? In what universe is that taken?" I tried again with: xXx_DragonLord_xXx

**[NAME UNAVAILABLE]**

"Come on!" One more attempt: NoobDestroyer420

**[NAME UNAVAILABLE]**

"This is ridiculous. Every decent gaming name is gone." I paused, thinking. "Fine, let's try something simple for once."

Able.

**[NAME ACCEPTED]**
**[CHARACTER CREATION COMPLETE]**
**[WELCOME TO AETHORIA]**

The interface faded, and suddenly I could see where I actually was. A narrow alley between two brick buildings, with garbage piled in the corners and the smell of... yeah, definitely garbage. Great starting location.

"Alright, time for breakfast. How do I log out of this thing?" I tried every gesture I could think of. Swiping, pinching, even saying "menu" out loud like an idiot. Nothing worked. "Come on, there's got to be an exit button somewhere."

I spent the next ten minutes searching through every interface I could find. Inventory, character sheet, skill tree, settings. No logout option anywhere. Not even a quit button.

"What kind of game doesn't let you quit?" I was starting to feel genuinely worried now. "Maybe it's one of those hardcore immersion things where you can only log out at safe zones?"

A glint caught my eye—a few copper coins scattered on the ground near my feet. I picked them up and counted. Five coppers total. Not exactly a fortune, but hey, free money was free money.

That's when I looked up and caught my reflection in a shop window. My own face stared back at me, not some generic fantasy character model. Same brown hair, same tired eyes, same five o'clock shadow I'd been meaning to shave for three days.

"Why's it using my actual face? I never use my real appearance in games." I touched my cheek, and the reflection matched perfectly. "At least it didn't give me back my scrawny body. This character actually looks like he lifts."

The sun was setting by the time I'd finished exploring the interface options. My stomach rumbled, reminding me I hadn't eaten since... yesterday? Time was getting weird.

I spotted a cafe with warm light spilling from its windows. The sign read "The Night Owl - Open 24 Hours." Perfect.

The barista looked at me like I'd crawled out of a dumpster, which wasn't entirely wrong. But when I slapped a copper coin on the counter and asked for coffee and whatever food that would buy, she softened up.

"Rough night, honey? You can sit in the corner if you want. We get a lot of folks who need a place to crash."

I found a table in the back and nursed my coffee. The sandwich was actually decent—real food, not some weird game abstraction. Everything felt so... real. The taste, the warmth of the cup in my hands, even the way my back ached from sleeping on hard ground.

"Maybe it's one of those full-dive VR rigs," I muttered to myself. "The kind that hijacks your nervous system. But those are still experimental, aren't they?"

I must have dozed off, because the next thing I knew, someone was gently shaking my shoulder. A girl about my age with shoulder-length brown hair and concerned green eyes was looking down at me.

"Hey there. You're a transfer, right?" She had this slight accent I couldn't place. "Have you figured it out yet?"

"Transfer? Uh, yeah, I guess. Just created my character." I sat up straighter, suddenly aware of how rough I probably looked. "Figured what out?"

"I'll tell you in a sec. First, how'd you do with the welcome committee? The locals here like to toss coins at new transfers until they wake up. It's become this weird tradition."

"Five coppers." I jingled the coins in my pocket. "Not exactly striking it rich, but it bought me dinner."

She winced. "Ouch. Most people leave way more than that on the ground. You must've arrived during a slow night." She slid into the seat across from me. "What you're supposed to figure out is that we can't leave. Nobody knows if this is actually a game or if we've been transported to some other world with game-like rules. But only transfers get the interface."

My blood went cold. "I thought my game was just bugged. I was going to file a support ticket in the morning."

She laughed, but there was no humor in it. "Yeah, we all went through that phase. I spent my first three days trying every logout method I could think of." She extended her hand. "I'm Misha, by the way. Cleric, level 11. If I'd known how hardcore this place was going to be, I would've rolled literally anything else."

"Able. Commander of Puppets, level 1." I shook her hand, noting how warm and solid it felt. "What do you mean, hardcore?"

"There's no respawn. If you die here, you're gone. Permanently." Her expression was dead serious. "I've been here two weeks, and I've seen people die. They never come back. No new character, no second chances."

The coffee in my stomach suddenly felt like acid. "Jesus."

"It gets worse. I'm a pure healer—no attack skills at all. Skill books for clerics are crazy expensive, and the drop rate is basically zero in the starting areas. I need a group to do anything, but most warriors don't need healing until they're past level 10 because their natural regen covers the early dungeon damage."

She paused to sip from a cup of tea that had appeared while we talked. "What's the last thing you remember from before waking up here? Do you remember buying a game or anything?"

I thought about it. "I was drinking at home, probably too much. Playing some mobile game on my phone." The memory felt fuzzy, like trying to remember a dream. "Games this realistic don't exist where I come from. Full-dive VR is still science fiction."

"Same here. Last thing I remember was walking home from university." Misha shrugged. "So either we're test subjects in some secret government program, or we've been transported to a world that runs on RPG rules."

"Commander of Puppets is supposed to be an advanced class, right? You used the random generator?" When I nodded, she continued. "You got lucky. It's like a one percent chance to roll an advanced class. Most people get Warrior or Mage."

"So the world's full of DPS classes with no support?" I felt a familiar gamer's dread creeping up my spine.

"Pretty much. High-level healers are treated like celebrities according to the news that filters down to this village. There are so many Warriors and Mages that people forget other classes exist until they desperately need one."

I shuddered. A world full of nothing but DPS was every support player's nightmare. "What about tanks?"

"Warriors can tank if they learn shield skills, but they're not great at it. The few people who random-rolled Paladin are basically gods. Other than Paladins, Clerics are the only real healers until level 50, when Shamans can learn healing totems."

I checked my character screen quickly. Commander of Puppets could use Shaman skill books. "How good are the healing totems?"

"Decent for group healing, but they won't keep a tank alive unless the tank's way overgeared or has self-healing." She glanced toward the door as three people walked in. "That's my party. I should go."

She stood up and dropped a silver coin on the table. "Breakfast is on me. The newbie dungeon is at the end of this street, turn left when you leave. Good luck, Able."

I watched her join the three-person group by the door—a big guy in leather armor, a girl with a staff, and another warrior type with a sword. They looked competent, experienced. The kind of group that had their act together.

Being stuck in a game world didn't sound entirely terrible, if I was being honest. Back home, I was a college dropout with a drinking problem, living on disability payments because my health was too shot to hold down a real job. My social life consisted of online gaming and the occasional text from friends I barely kept in touch with.

Maybe this was an upgrade.

I finished my coffee and stood up, feeling oddly optimistic for the first time in months. Time to see what this Commander of Puppets class could actually do.
