# Chapter 2: First Dungeon

After breakfast—another sandwich and coffee to stretch my meager budget—I headed toward what Misha had called the starting dungeon. My stomach felt better, but my wallet definitely didn't.

A short line had formed outside a stone archway that definitely hadn't been there when I'd walked past earlier. The entrance shimmered slightly, like heat waves rising from summer pavement. A few people ahead of me glanced at my tattered brown robes before quickly looking away.

"Probably think I'm some kind of monk class," I muttered. There had been a few melee options in the character creation that looked similar.

"Hey, rookie!" A guy in decent leather armor called out as his three-person party emerged from the dungeon entrance. "Got a weapon yet?"

I shook my head, suddenly feeling very underprepared.

"Here." He tossed me a wooden baseball bat. "Cost me a copper at the weapon shop, but they won't buy 'em back. I just like using them for that satisfying *thunk* sound." He laughed and walked away with his group.

Most people were going in solo. His three-person team was actually unusual. Then I watched them get back in line and realized what was happening—they were farming this place. Power leveling.

When I reached the front, an NPC attendant looked at some kind of timer counting down from one minute. When it hit zero, he pushed me through without a word.

"Well, that was weird. Instance timer maybe?" The complete lack of explanation would've been a nightmare for actual new players, but I'd dealt with enough janky game mechanics to roll with it.

Time to see what this Commander of Puppets class could actually do.

I pulled up my skill interface and activated my only ability.

**[Summon Lesser Golem]**

Two small clay figures materialized beside me, about knee-high with crude wooden daggers clutched in their stubby hands. Not exactly intimidating, but hey—free minions.

**[Command Interface Activated]**
**[Default Behavior: Follow, Aggressive]**

A mental link snapped into place, and suddenly I could sense both golems like extra limbs. It was trippy as hell, but also kind of awesome.

The first pack of enemies appeared around a corner: one gray wolf and three angry-looking rabbits. Not exactly the epic fantasy adventure I'd imagined, but armed with a baseball bat and wearing rags, they might actually be dangerous.

My golems immediately charged the rabbits like they had some personal vendetta. The mental link let me feel their simple, aggressive thoughts—basically just "DESTROY ENEMIES" on repeat. Good enough for now.

The wolf ignored the chaotic rabbit-golem brawl and came straight for me. Classic aggro mechanics. It lunged at my throat, and I barely managed to swing the bat in time.

"First one always catches you off guard," I grunted, knocking the wolf sideways. A green health bar appeared above its head, immediately shifting to yellow. Wounded, but still fighting.

A second swing caught it in the ribs and it dropped. My inventory pinged with a notification: **[Wolf Claw acquired]**. Seconds later, I got **[Small Pelt x2]** as my golems finished off the rabbits.

"Not bad for a bunch of clay midgets," I said, watching them automatically regenerate back to full health. That was definitely a useful feature.

The next pack—two wolves—proved easier. With the golems tanking damage, I could focus on clubbing things to death. Three more claws and a piece of wolf meat joined my growing collection.

"Hope someone in town buys this stuff," I muttered, examining the raw meat with mild disgust. "Has to be useful for something, right?"

Three packs later, a notification flashed across my vision:

**[LEVEL 2 ACHIEVED!]**
**[+5 Attribute Points Available]**
**[+1 Skill Point Available]**

"Sweet! That wasn't too bad." I quickly dumped the attribute points into Intelligence and Command, figuring more mana and better minion control were priorities.

The rest of the dungeon was more of the same—rabbits, wolves, the occasional angry squirrel. Nothing too challenging until I reached the final chamber and came face to face with a dire wolf the size of a small car.

This thing completely ignored my golems, shrugging off their pathetic knife attacks like mosquito bites. It came straight for me, forcing me into a frantic twenty-minute game of hit-and-run with a baseball bat.

When it finally dropped, something shiny caught my eye on the ground.

**[Skill Book: Poisoned Arrow]**
**[Compatible Classes: Ranger, Hunter, Rogue]**
**[Rarity: Uncommon]**

"Holy shit, a skill book!" I stared at the glowing tome. "Misha said these things were super rare."

**[LEVEL 3 ACHIEVED!]**
**[DUNGEON CLEAR!]**
**[New Skill Slot Unlocked!]**

I could learn the Poisoned Arrow skill right now if I had a bow. The description said it created magical arrows, but required a ranged weapon to fire them. Time for some shopping.

Back in town, I sold my collected loot for five silver coins. The weapon shop had a basic hunting bow for one silver—not great, but functional. I bought it along with ten beginner healing potions for another silver. The potions were apparently useless after level 10, but they made me feel more secure.

"So that's why nobody needs healers early on," I realized. "Couple silver for a weapon and some pots, and you're set."

The dungeon line was much shorter on my second run. Made sense—most newbies probably only did one or two runs per day to avoid exhaustion or permanent injury.

I equipped the bow and learned Poisoned Arrow, then dove back in. The difference was immediately apparent. Having a ranged option completely changed my tactics, even if my aim was terrible at first.

"This wolf is impossible to hit," I grumbled, missing my third shot in a row before switching back to the bat when it got too close. I was so focused on aiming that I barely used any mana.

But I was getting better. All those archery videos I'd watched during my unemployed gaming binges were finally paying off. By the time I reached the boss again, I could reliably hit stationary targets.

The dire wolf boss spawned with its back turned this time, giving me a perfect opportunity. I took careful aim and sent a Poisoned Arrow straight into its flank. The purple "POISONED" status effect appeared above its head as I nocked a second arrow.

My follow-up shot caught it center mass before my golems engaged. Instead of rushing in with the bat, I stayed back and watched the poison slowly drain its health while my minions kept it distracted.

"No point risking my neck when I've got perfectly good cannon fodder," I said, feeling pretty clever about the whole strategy.

When the boss finally collapsed, I'd gained enough experience for a nice chunk toward level 4, plus another handful of loot to sell.

"I definitely need to practice this archery thing more," I decided, shouldering my bow. "But first, I need to find somewhere better to sleep than that cafe. And maybe some actual armor that doesn't look like I robbed a monk."

The golems dissolved as I left the dungeon, but I could feel them waiting just a thought away. For the first time since waking up in this world, I was starting to feel like I might actually survive here.

Now I just needed to figure out what the hell was really going on.
