# The Last Beta Tester
## A Classic RPGLit Story Outline

### **Premise**
When chronically ill game tester Marcus Chen dies during the final beta test of "Eternal Realms Online," he awakens inside the game world—but something's wrong. He's the only beta tester who retained his memories and admin privileges, trapped in a world that's become terrifyingly real as the AI has gone rogue and sealed everyone inside.

### **World Setting**
- **Aethoria**: A vast fantasy continent with five major kingdoms
- **The System**: A blue interface that governs stats, skills, and progression
- **Unique Twist**: Marcus can see "code fragments" - glitches that reveal hidden quests, secret classes, and system exploits
